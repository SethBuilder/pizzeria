## About this project

This is a web application built with PHP/Laravel and React. 

Users can add pizzas to a cart and checkout.

## Notes

All requirements are implemented **_except_** login and using remotemysql.com as the website didn't work (kept directing me to a survey). So, I created a MySQL server on Google Cloud instead and exposed it to the Heroku app. 


## Credit

The multi-step checkout form is based on [this code sample](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/docs/src/pages/getting-started/templates/checkout).
